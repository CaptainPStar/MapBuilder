A complete objectlist from read config.
Objectmanipulation (Pos,Pitch,Bank,Yaw,....).
Selections (Movement of groups of objects).
Copy & Paste.
Simple export for Terrain Builder.
Works in Multiplayer.
More to come.


Planned Features

Saving and loading of projects.
Layers of objects.
Brush-Mode (Draw forests, bushes, rocks, streetposts, lamps, etc).
Fence-Mode (Draw a line of snapping fences).
Everything you wish and I am able to script.

Installation

Extract the mission archive to your missions-folder (MapBuilder.VR to somethign like C:\Users\Nickname\Documents\Arma 3 - Other Profiles\Profilename\missions). Rename the folders extension to the island on which you want to use the editor.
Extract @MapBuilder to your ArmA3-Folder or a Subfolder and load it with your favorite method to load mods (launcher, commandline, parameterfile, etc).

You can start the editor while previewing the mission in your action menu.

Export

Press the export button and all objects will be written to a file (@MapBuilder/exports/TBexports.txt). 
Beware: Exporting multiple times will overwrite the last export for now. Custom filenames are coming soon.
