[ ] When creating a replacement control for sidebar, copy all the current settings from old to new

[x] Create a "Close" button for windows
  This doesn't work. ctrlDelete makes the game crash?
[ ] Create the "Help" button for window



[ ] Make panes for all the current windows that should be moved around (Favorites, Used objects, etc)
  * [ ] Allow Button % scales, so when you change the width the button stays a certain percentage
  * [x] Make minimum X and minimum Y sizes when resizing. Make sure windows don't become unworkable (Use collapsing instead!)
